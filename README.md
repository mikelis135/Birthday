# Birthday
App that shows a list of birthdays

## Stacks

- Kotlin
- Mvvm Architecture
- Repository pattern
- Room Database
- Retrofit Network

## Approaching the challenge

- My aim for this app is easy testability, clear structure, offline capability, easy pagination and scrolling, good user experience, if there's time will supoort dark mode
- I'll be importing libraries that will help achieve this goal and writing my code in that effect 

## How to run the app

- Clone or download the repo to your computer and open in anroid studio, then run and install on your physical device or emulator

## Destination

- An app that gets list of birthdays from the server in batches 
- As users scroll down it gets more birthdays, there are about 10,000 of those birthdays
- Birthdays are stored in the database locally, to support offline feature
- A solid pattern to allow creating of fake classes for easy testing is implemented
- A reactive model is used so changes react on the user interface

## Thank you!
